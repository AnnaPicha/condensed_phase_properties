This repo condensed_phase_properties contains the functions and exemplary input data for water that were used to compute thermodynamic properties. In the data folder, all published data is available (thermodynamic data and diffusion constants).


- Free software: MIT
- Documentation: https://apicha.github.io/condensed-phase-properties.


## Features

The functions computing condensed phase properties use openff-toolkit, which has not been released for python 3.13 yet. So create an environment with python==3.12. Then, clone and install this package with
-  pip install .
- install openff-toolkit


## Credits

This package was created with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and the [`mgancita/cookiecutter-pypackage`](https://mgancita.github.io/cookiecutter-pypackage/) project template.
